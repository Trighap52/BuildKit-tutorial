# Enabling BuildKit

By default, Docker uses the old build system. To use BuildKit, you need to enable it. You can do this by setting an environment variable or updating Dockerâ€™s configuration file.

## **Installing Buildx (Required for BuildKit)**

If BuildKit is enabled but you encounter an error regarding the **Buildx** component being missing or broken, follow these steps to install and configure Docker **Buildx**:

### **Step 1: Install Buildx**
To install Buildx, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins
curl -L https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/download/v0.10.5/buildx-v0.10.5.linux-amd64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx
chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx
```

### **Step 2: Create a Buildx Builder**
After installing Buildx, create a new builder and set it as the default:

```bash
docker buildx create --use
```

Verify the builder is active by running:

```bash
docker buildx ls
```

Once Buildx is installed and the builder is active, you can proceed to enable BuildKit as described below.

## Option 1: Temporary Session-based Setup
To enable BuildKit for your current session, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
```
## Option 2: Permanent Setup

If you want BuildKit to be enabled permanently, you can configure Docker's settings to always use BuildKit.

- **On Linux**:
  1. Open the Docker daemon configuration file, which is typically located at `/etc/docker/daemon.json`.
  2. Add the following configuration to enable BuildKit:
     ```json
     {
       "features": {
         "buildkit": true
       }
     }
     ```
  3. Save the file and restart Docker for the changes to take effect:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart docker
     ```

- **On Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac)**:
  1. Open **Docker Desktop**.
  2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Docker Engine**.
  3. Add the following line under the `"settings"` object in the JSON configuration:
     ```json
     {
       "features": {
         "buildkit": true
       }
     }
     ```
  4. Click **Apply & Restart** to enable BuildKit permanently.

Once BuildKit is enabled, Docker will always use it as the default build system.
