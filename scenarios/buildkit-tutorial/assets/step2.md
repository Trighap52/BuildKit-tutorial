# Enabling BuildKit

By default, Docker uses the old build system. To use BuildKit, you need to enable it. You can do this by setting an environment variable or updating Dockerâ€™s configuration file.

## Option 1: Temporary Session-based Setup
To enable BuildKit for your current session, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
```
## Option 2: Permanent Setup

If you want BuildKit to be enabled permanently, you can configure Docker's settings to always use BuildKit.

- **On Linux**:
  1. Open the Docker daemon configuration file, which is typically located at `/etc/docker/daemon.json`.
  2. Add the following configuration to enable BuildKit:
     ```json
     {
       "features": {
         "buildkit": true
       }
     }
     ```
  3. Save the file and restart Docker for the changes to take effect:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart docker
     ```

- **On Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac)**:
  1. Open **Docker Desktop**.
  2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Docker Engine**.
  3. Add the following line under the `"settings"` object in the JSON configuration:
     ```json
     {
       "features": {
         "buildkit": true
       }
     }
     ```
  4. Click **Apply & Restart** to enable BuildKit permanently.

Once BuildKit is enabled, Docker will always use it as the default build system.

Click **Next** to proceed with enabling BuildKit and optimizing your Docker builds!
