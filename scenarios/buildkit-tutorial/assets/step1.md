# Prerequisites

Before we dive into using BuildKit, let’s cover the basic requirements to ensure you are ready to follow along smoothly.

## 1. Docker Knowledge
- **Basic Docker commands**: You should be comfortable with creating, building, and running containers. If you're unfamiliar with Docker, it’s recommended to review the basics of creating and running containers.
- **Creating Dockerfiles**: Familiarity with Dockerfile syntax is important, as we will be working with Dockerfiles to demonstrate BuildKit’s capabilities. Don’t worry if you’re not an expert; the examples will guide you step-by-step.

## 2. Technical Setup
- **Docker Installed**: Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. This tutorial will assume you're using Docker Desktop (on Windows/Mac) or Docker on Linux.
  - If you don’t have Docker installed, you can follow [Docker's official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
