In this part, we will look at how to use **OPA** to enforce access control policies in a **microservices architecture**. This is particularly useful when managing complex, distributed systems, where different services have specific security and access requirements.

OPA can be deployed alongside each microservice as a **sidecar container** to handle authorization and policy enforcement, ensuring that only valid requests are processed by the service.

---

### **Step 1: Deploy OPA as a Sidecar in a Microservice**

Let’s start by adding OPA as a sidecar to one of your microservices. In Kubernetes, this means updating the deployment configuration to include OPA alongside the microservice container.

1. **Modify the Kubernetes Deployment**:
   - Open the Kubernetes deployment configuration file for your microservice (e.g., `microservice-deployment.yaml`).

2. **Add OPA as a Sidecar Container**:
   Add the following sidecar container definition to the deployment YAML file:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: microservice
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: microservice
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: microservice
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: microservice
           image: myregistry.com/microservice:latest
           ports:
             - containerPort: 8080
         - name: opa
           image: openpolicyagent/opa:latest
           args:
             - "run"
             - "--server"
             - "--config-file=/path/to/config.yaml"  # OPA config file
           ports:
             - containerPort: 8181   # OPA listens on this port
   ```

   - This configuration deploys your microservice alongside an OPA container.
   - The OPA sidecar listens on port 8181 and enforces policies before requests reach the microservice.

---

### **Step 2: Write a Basic Authorization Policy in Rego**

Now, let’s define a simple **Rego** policy that allows or denies requests based on a valid token. The policy will be enforced by the OPA sidecar.

1. **Create a Policy File** (`policy.rego`):
   Create a new Rego policy file that defines the access control rules for your microservice.

   ```rego
   package httpapi.authz

   default allow = false

   # Allow the request if the token is valid
   allow {
     input.token == "valid-token"
   }
   ```

   - This policy denies all requests by default unless the provided token equals `"valid-token"`.

2. **Deploy the Policy**:
   Save the policy file (`policy.rego`) to a location where OPA can access it. You can use a ConfigMap to mount the policy into the OPA sidecar.

---

### **Step 3: Configure the Microservice to Query OPA for Authorization**

Next, modify the microservice so that it queries the OPA sidecar to check if the incoming requests are authorized.

1. **Update the Microservice Code**:
   Before processing each request, the microservice sends a query to OPA to check if the request is allowed. Below is an example in **Node.js** (but the same concept applies to other languages).

   ```javascript
   const http = require('http');

   // Incoming request handler
   const requestHandler = (req, res) => {
     const token = req.headers['authorization']; // Get token from headers

     // Send a query to OPA for authorization
     const options = {
       hostname: 'localhost',
       port: 8181,
       path: '/v1/data/httpapi/authz/allow',
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       },
     };

     const opaReq = http.request(options, opaRes => {
       let data = '';
       opaRes.on('data', chunk => data += chunk);
       opaRes.on('end', () => {
         const result = JSON.parse(data);

         if (result.result) {
           // If allowed, process the request
           res.writeHead(200);
           res.end('Request allowed');
         } else {
           // If denied, block the request
           res.writeHead(403);
           res.end('Request denied');
         }
       });
     });

     // Send the token as input to OPA
     opaReq.write(JSON.stringify({ input: { token } }));
     opaReq.end();
   };

   // Create the server
   const server = http.createServer(requestHandler);
   server.listen(8080);
   ```

   - The microservice sends a request to OPA’s `/v1/data/httpapi/authz/allow` endpoint, passing the token as input.
   - OPA evaluates the request against the Rego policy and returns a result (`true` or `false`), determining if the request is allowed.

---

### **Step 4: Test the Policy**

Now, let's test the policy to see how OPA enforces access control:

1. **Deploy the Updated Microservice**:
   Deploy the modified microservice and OPA sidecar on Kubernetes.

2. **Send Requests**:
   - **Valid Request**: Send a request with the correct token:

     ```bash
     curl -H "Authorization: valid-token" http://<microservice-ip>:8080
     ```

     This request should be allowed, and you’ll receive a response of `Request allowed`.

   - **Invalid Request**: Send a request without a token or with an invalid token:

     ```bash
     curl -H "Authorization: invalid-token" http://<microservice-ip>:8080
     ```

     This request should be blocked, and you’ll receive a response of `Request denied`.

### **What We Learned and Why This is Useful**

In this step, we learned how to use OPA as an authorization service for microservices by deploying it as a sidecar. This approach decouples policy enforcement from the microservice, allowing you to:
- **Implement centralized access control** across all microservices.
- **Ensure consistent authorization policies** without modifying the application code.
- **Easily update policies** without redeploying the microservice, simply by updating the OPA policy.

This is particularly valuable for securing microservices in a distributed system, ensuring that requests are properly authorized before reaching the service.
