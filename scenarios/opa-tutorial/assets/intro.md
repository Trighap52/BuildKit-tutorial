## Introduction

In Kubernetes, managing and enforcing policies across clusters is crucial for maintaining security, compliance, and operational consistency. Manual enforcement of these policies can be error-prone and hard to scale. This is where **Open Policy Agent (OPA) Gatekeeper** comes into play.

OPA Gatekeeper provides a Kubernetes-native way to enforce custom policies declaratively. By using **Constraint Templates** and **Constraints**, you can define fine-grained policies to control what resources are allowed in your cluster, ensuring that security and operational policies are consistently enforced without manual intervention.

## Motivation

As Kubernetes environments scale, ensuring consistent policy enforcement across clusters becomes challenging. OPA Gatekeeper solves this problem by automating the enforcement of security and compliance policies, reducing human error and allowing for consistent, scalable governance.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
1. Install and configure **OPA Gatekeeper** on a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Define a **Constraint Template** and create policies using the **Rego** policy language.
3. Apply policies to Kubernetes resources using **Constraints**.
4. Test and validate policy enforcement on container images within Kubernetes.
