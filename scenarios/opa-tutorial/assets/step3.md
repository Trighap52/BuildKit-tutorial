# Key Features of BuildKit

Before moving on, let’s quickly recap what makes BuildKit different:
- **Build performance**: BuildKit optimizes the building process by enabling parallelism, improved caching, and more efficient layering.
- **Security**: One of BuildKit's standout features is the ability to pass secrets securely during the build without leaving them in the final image.
- **Multi-stage builds**: BuildKit enhances support for multi-stage builds, allowing for smaller, more optimized Docker images.

With this knowledge, you are ready to proceed to the hands-on sections, where we’ll explore how to leverage these features.
