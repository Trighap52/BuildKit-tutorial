# Welcome to the "Faster and More Secure Docker Builds with BuildKit" Tutorial

## Motivation
In modern DevOps workflows, Docker is a cornerstone technology for building, shipping, and running applications in containers. However, as applications grow in complexity, the build process can become inefficient, leading to slower iterations and increased security risks. 

**BuildKit**, an advanced build engine integrated with Docker, addresses these issues by providing:
- **Faster build times** through improved parallelism and caching.
- **Smaller image sizes** by leveraging multi-stage builds.
- **Enhanced security** by allowing secrets to be securely managed during the build process.

By optimizing your builds with BuildKit, you can speed up your CI/CD pipelines, reduce deployment times, and improve the overall efficiency of your containerized applications. This makes BuildKit a powerful tool for modern DevOps teams seeking faster, more secure build processes.

## Intended Learning Outcomes
By the end of this tutorial, you will:
- Understand the benefits of using BuildKit over Docker’s default builder.
- Set up and enable BuildKit in a local environment or a CI/CD pipeline.
- Optimize Docker builds using BuildKit features such as:
  - **Build caching** for faster rebuilds.
  - **Multi-stage builds** to reduce image size.
  - **Secrets management** for securely passing sensitive information during the build process.
- Improve overall build performance, leading to faster deployments and better security practices.

## What to Expect
In this hands-on tutorial, you’ll follow a series of steps to explore BuildKit’s advanced features. You’ll start by enabling BuildKit, then proceed to optimize a Dockerfile with multi-stage builds, and finally secure your builds by managing secrets in a safe manner.
